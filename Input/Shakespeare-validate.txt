Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity
Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.

But since you come too late of our intents,
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
I will about it straight;
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
Shame to him whose cruel striking

To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,

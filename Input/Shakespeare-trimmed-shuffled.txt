Definitively thus I answer you.
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
Will I withal endow a child of thine;
Sits safe and still without him.
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
And when I mount, alive may I not light,
no more words.
So it is.
My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.
Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine.
That which my daughter came to look upon,
For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated:

Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
But see, while idly I stood looking on,
As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
To see these honours in possession.
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,

Four or five women once that tended me?

That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.
Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.

And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.

A precious ring, a ring that I must use
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,

To gratulate the gentle princes there.
More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;
Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
Madam, if you could find out but a man

There's some ill planet reigns:
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
And bestial appetite in change of lust;
Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
For at their hands I have deserved no pity.
Alack, why am I sent for to a king,

Follow me.
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,

And for this once my will shall stand for law.

Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
A noble cunning: you were used to load me
And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.

All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march:
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.

I came to serve a king and not a duke.
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
COMINIUS:
Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,
Thus far into the bowels of the land
MARIANA:
Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
And in the towns, as they do march along,
Only make trial what your love can do
Which we will second. When he lies along,

Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
So cowards fight when they can fly no further;
With repetition of my Romeo's name.

Nor I, nor any
Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,
All this I know; and to the marriage
O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee
As well as one so great and so forlorn
To Edward, but not to the English king.
Which puts some of us in distemper, but
If you would seek us,
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.

O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
My mind will never grant what I perceive
And be not easily won to our request:
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
Such terrible impression made the dream.
O, that your young nobility could judge
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
The causes of their death appear, unto
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?

LORD ROSS:
A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd
But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:

A league below the city; and from thence,

Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march
Why do you look on us, and shake your head,

In our remove be thou at full ourself;
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:

Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.
